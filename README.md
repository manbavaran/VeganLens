# 🥬 VeganLens

**A simple scanner that tells you whether your food is vegan — powered by OCR and ingredient matching.**

## 📌 What is VeganLens?

VeganLens is a lightweight AI-powered tool that uses OCR to extract text from ingredient labels and determines whether the food is vegan. It detects animal-derived substances based on a keyword-matching system and provides clear feedback for plant-based consumers.

✅ Usage

python main.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
Optional flags:

--lang en : Language setting for OCR (default: English)

--verbose : Print full ingredient breakdown



🧠 How it Works
OCR extracts text from a food label image.

Extracted text is tokenized and normalized.

Keywords are matched against a custom list of non-vegan substances (e.g., milk, gelatin, casein, honey).

If any matches are found, GreenScan marks the product as non-vegan.

You can easily expand keywords.json to include more terms, derivatives, or language variants.


📌 Roadmap
 Add mobile version

 Expand to multi-language support

 Build a simple web interface

 Connect to Open Food Facts API

 Support allergen analysis (future add-on)
